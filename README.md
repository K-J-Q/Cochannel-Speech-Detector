# Cochannel Speech Detector using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a cochannel speech detector using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately detect and separate multiple speakers in a noisy environment, such as a crowded room or a busy street.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
